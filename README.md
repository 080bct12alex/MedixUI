# 🖥️ Medix UI – Patient Management System (Next.js Frontend)

This is the **frontend** for the Patient Management System built using **Next.js (App Router)**. It connects to a FastAPI backend to manage patient records including BMI calculation, CRUD operations, and health verdicts.

🧑‍⚕️ Doctors can log in, view, create, update, and delete their patient records — all from a clean and responsive web interface.
